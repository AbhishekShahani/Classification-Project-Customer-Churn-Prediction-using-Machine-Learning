The objective of this project is to use machine learning techniques to classify customers of a telephone company into two categories: churned or not churned. Churned customers are those who have stopped using the companyâ€™s services or switched to another provider.
The project involves the following steps:
Data preprocessing: This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model selection: This involves choosing and comparing different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest classifier to find the best model for the classification task.
Model evaluation: This involves measuring the performance of the selected model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
The project aims to provide insights into the factors that affect customer churn and help the company to retain its customers and increase its revenue.
